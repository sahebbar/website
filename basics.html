		<h1>CSS background-color example</h1>
		<div>
			This is a text inside the div element
			<p>This is paragraph has its own background color.</p>
			We are still in the div element
		</div>
		<h1>Hello World</h1>
		<p>Now the background image is only shown once, and positioned away from the text</p>
		<p>In this example we have also added a marigin on the right side, so that the background image will never disturb the text</p>
		<p>This is an ordinary paragraph. Notice that this test is red. The default text color for a page is defined in the body sector</p>
		<p class="ex">This is a paragraph with class="ex". This text is blue.</p>
